[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-Paper-<COLOR>.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16022)


Codes and models will be released soon (maybe 1 or 2 weeks), please stay tuned, your star will help facilitate the process.

## Qualitative Comparison
PuLID maintains high ID fidelity while effectively reducing interference with the original model's behavior.

## Application
We provide the applications of our PuLID in blow, encompassing style alterations (1st row), IP fusion (2nd row), accessories modification (3rd row), recontextualization (4th row), attributes editing (5th row), transformation from non-photo-realistic domains to photo-realistic ones (6th row), and ID mixing (7th row).
